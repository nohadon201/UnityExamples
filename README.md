# Unity Projects Repository

Welcome to the Unity Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of Unity projects organized into four main units: UF1, UF2, UF3, and UF4. Each unit explores progressively advanced topics in Unity game development.

## Units Overview

### UF1: Basics of 2D Environments
- Introduction to Unity fundamentals
- Basic concepts like rotations, velocities in 2D environments
- Foundational skills for game development

### UF2: Scriptable Objects and Animations
- Introduction to Scriptable Objects for data persistence
- Advanced 2D animations
- Building on UF1 concepts for a deeper understanding

### UF3: Introduction to 3D Environments
- Transition to 3D game development
- Exploring physics, basic rotations, and 3D environments
- Introduction to raycasting and layers in Unity

### UF4: Experimental Topics
- Machine Learning integration in Unity projects
- Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)
- Multiplayer game development
- Procedural generation techniques

## Project Structure
The repository is structured to easily navigate through the different units and projects. Each unit has its dedicated folder (UF1, UF2, UF3, UF4), and within each folder, you'll find specific projects and exams related to that unit.

## Getting Started
To get started with any project, follow these general steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Unity Hub and add the project by selecting the appropriate Unity version.
3. Explore the project folders and open the desired Unity scene.
4. Read the project-specific README files for additional instructions.

## Units Details

### UF1: Basics of 2D Environments
This unit focuses on foundational Unity concepts in 2D game development. The projects within this unit cover basic rotations, velocities, and essential skills for creating games in a 2D space.

### UF2: Scriptable Objects and Animations
Building on the basics learned in UF1, UF2 introduces Scriptable Objects for data persistence and delves into advanced 2D animations. This unit enhances your understanding of project structure and data management.

### UF3: Introduction to 3D Environments
UF3 marks the transition to 3D game development. Projects cover physics, basic 3D rotations, and the introduction of raycasting and layers in Unity. This unit prepares you for the challenges of working in three-dimensional spaces.

### UF4: Experimental Topics
In UF4, we explore experimental topics pushing the boundaries of Unity development. Projects within this unit include the integration of Machine Learning, DOTS, Multiplayer functionality, and procedural generation techniques.

Feel free to explore each unit, work on the projects, and expand your Unity skills! If you have any questions or encounter issues, refer to the specific project's README or reach out to the community for assistance.
